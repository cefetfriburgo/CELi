Add the modern functionality of a sticky header that appears on scroll to your theme.

== Description ==

The "Simple Sticky Header on Scroll" plugin adds a slide-down sticky header to any WordPress theme. When scrolling down, the header appears and presents quick navigation opportunities for the user; this is a modern usability solution that's more and more popular these days, and now you can add a sticky header to your site without having to switch or alter your current theme in any way.
